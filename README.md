# PlayerIndexer — Roblox package

PlayerIndexer is a Wally-style package that can be used to reduce networking when sending player instances as packets. Instead of sending 5bytes of data, this synced 8bit indexer package significantly reduces to an 8bit unsigned integer.

# Build — Wally installation
